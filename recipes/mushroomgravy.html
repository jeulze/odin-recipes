<h3>Description</h3>

<p> <strong><em>Mushroom gravy</strong></em> is a rich, savory sauce made with earthy mushrooms, butter, and aromatic herbs, creating 
    a velvety texture that enhances a variety of dishes. This comforting gravy is a favorite addition to 
    holiday meals, especially Christmas, where it’s often served alongside roasted meats, mashed potatoes, 
    or stuffing. Its deep umami flavor intertwines beautifully with the rustic sweetness of cornbread, soaking 
    into its crumbly texture for a harmonious blend of flavors. Whether drizzled generously or served on the 
    side, mushroom gravy brings a cozy, celebratory touch to Christmas dinner.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>2 cups mushrooms, finely sliced (button, cremini, or a mix)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 cups vegetable or chicken broth</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 tsp fresh thyme leaves (or 1/2 tsp dried thyme)</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
    <li>2 tbsp heavy cream or milk</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Sauté the aromatics: </strong>Heat butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, cooking until softened and fragrant, about 3 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook the mushrooms: </strong>Add the sliced mushrooms to the skillet and cook for 6–8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they release their moisture and turn golden brown.</li>
    <li><strong>Make the roux: </strong>Sprinkle the flour evenly over the mushrooms and stir well to coat. Cook for 1–2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the broth: </strong>Gradually pour in the broth while whisking continuously to prevent lumps. Stir in the soy sauce, thyme, salt, and pepper.</li>
    <li><strong>Simmer: </strong>Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 5–7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the gravy thickens to your desired consistency.</li>
    <li><strong>Add cream (optional): </strong>For a richer gravy, stir in the heavy cream or milk and cook for another minute.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve: </strong>Remove from heat and serve warm over cornbread, mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, or meats.</li>
</ol>
