    <em><strong>Cornbread stuffing</strong></em> is a hearty and flavorful side dish that perfectly complements holiday feasts and comforting 
    family dinners. Made with crumbly, golden cornbread and a medley of savory ingredients like onions, celery, and 
    fragrant herbs, it brings a rich, Southern-inspired twist to traditional stuffing. Often baked until golden and 
    crisp on top, this dish combines the rustic sweetness of cornbread with the earthy warmth of spices, creating a 
    satisfying balance of textures and flavors. Whether served alongside turkey or enjoyed as a standalone dish, 
    cornbread stuffing is a crowd-pleasing favorite.
