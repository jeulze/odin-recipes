<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    <em><strong>Cornbread stuffing</strong></em> is a hearty and flavorful side dish that perfectly complements holiday feasts and comforting 
    family dinners. Made with crumbly, golden cornbread and a medley of savory ingredients like onions, celery, and 
    fragrant herbs, it brings a rich, Southern-inspired twist to traditional stuffing. Often baked until golden and 
    crisp on top, this dish combines the rustic sweetness of cornbread with the earthy warmth of spices, creating a 
    satisfying balance of textures and flavors. Whether served alongside turkey or enjoyed as a standalone dish, 
    cornbread stuffing is a crowd-pleasing favorite.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>For the cornbread:</strong></li>
        <li>2 cups cornmeal or cornbread mix (prepared in advance, crumbled)</li>
        
    <li><strong>For the stuffing:</strong></li>
    <li>4 cups cornbread, crumbled</li>
    <li>3 cups day-old bread cubes (white or rustic bread)</li>
    <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 large onion, finely diced</li>
    <li>3 celery stalks, finely diced</li>
    <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>1 tbsp fresh sage, chopped (or 1 tsp dried sage)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves (or 1 tsp dried thyme)</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp rosemary, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
    <li>2 1/2 to 3 cups chicken or vegetable broth</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>     
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the cornbread:</strong>
        If not already made, prepare cornbread a day ahead. Let it cool completely, 
        then crumble it into pieces and allow it to dry slightly overnight for better texture.</li>
    <li><strong>Preheat the oven: </strong>Preheat your oven to 190°C. Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
    <li><strong>Sauté the aromatics: </strong>In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add 
        the diced onion and celery, cooking until softened, about 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the garlic, sage, 
        thyme, and rosemary, cooking for an additional minute. Remove from heat.</li>
    <li><strong>Mix the stuffing: </strong>In a large mixing bowl, combine the crumbled cornbread, bread 
        cubes, sautéed aromatics, salt, and pepper. Toss until evenly mixed.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the liquids: </strong>Gradually pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, mixing gently 
        until the bread is moist but not soggy. Stir in the beaten eggs, ensuring the mixture is well combined.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake: </strong>Transfer the stuffing mixture to the prepared baking dish, spreading it evenly. 
        Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and bake uncovered for an additional 
        15 to 20 minutes, or until the top is golden and slightly crisp.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve: </strong>Let the cornbread stuffing cool for a few minutes before serving. It pairs 
        beautifully with roasted meats, gravies, and holiday spreads.</li>
