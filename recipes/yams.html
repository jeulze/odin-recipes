        <em><strong>Candied yams</strong></em> are a classic comfort food and a beloved staple at holiday tables, especially during Thanksgiving. 
        Made with tender slices of yams coated in a buttery, sweet glaze infused with warm spices like cinnamon and 
        nutmeg, this dish is a perfect balance of richness and sweetness. Often baked until caramelized and golden, 
        candied yams bring a cozy, nostalgic flavor to any meal. Whether paired with savory roasts or enjoyed on their 
        own, they are a timeless recipe that adds a touch of indulgence to every bite.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large yams, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong>
            Preheat your oven to 190Â°C.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the yams:</strong>
            Arrange the sliced yams in a single layer in a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the candied mixture:</strong>
            In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the 
            brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger (if using), 
            and a pinch of salt. Cook until the sugars dissolve and the mixture 
            is smooth, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the 
            vanilla extract.</li>
        <li><strong>Coat the yams:</strong>
            Pour the candied mixture evenly over the yams, ensuring all pieces are 
            coated. Add the water or orange juice to the dish, pouring around the 
            edges to prevent diluting the glaze directly on the yams.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong>
            Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the 
            foil, gently stir the yams to ensure even coating, and bake uncovered 
            for another 15 minutes or until the yams are tender and caramelized.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
                Let the candied yams cool slightly before serving. They are perfect 
                as a side dish for holiday feasts or any comforting meal.</li>
    </ol>
