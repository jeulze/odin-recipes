# odin-recipes

This project is to practice my HTML skills and put in place the last few lessons.

THe first instance is made with HTML and I will be adding styling with CSS later down the track.

I will be reflecting on what I have learned throughout this project here after I have completed the task.

What have I learnt?

I have learnt the importance of relative folders and how to link them properly to avoid image and page linking errors. When uploading and using the github server preview, it gave me an error where I couldn't see images and I was unable to navigate back to the home page - returning with an error 404 when attempted.

to fix this I changed the directory of the image links from "../images/image.html" to "/odin-project/images/image.html" this worked as a fix for the image issue.

To fix my issue with the linking to the index file I changed the <!-- "<a href="/index.html">Home</a>" to "<a href="../index.html">Home</a>" --> to allow for relative linking so users could navigate the site without issue.
